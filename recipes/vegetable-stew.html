    <h2>Desription</h2>
        <p>Easy to make, this hearty and nutritious roasted vegetable lentil stew is a family favorite for chilly evenings. This vegan dinner is rich in flavor from roasting vegetables and garlic at a high heat which creates sweet undertones. If you’re like me and always feel short on time and don’t want to babysit something on the stove for hours, this is a great easy vegan dinner recipe for you. The vegetables are roasted so they hang out with only one toss during baking. The lentil stew base cooks quickly and then it’s a matter of blending up half of the roasted veggies with some stock and pouring it back into the pot with the remaining roasted veggies. Add in some kale and you’re done! From start to finish, this lentil stew takes an hour to get on the table, but only about 15 minutes of this involves you being active.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Roasted Vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper. Place the roasting vegetables on the tray (except the garlic), drizzle with olive oil and toss well with a large spoon or your hands ensuring that all the veggies are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Slice the pointed end of the garlic bulb off exposing the garlic cloves. Drizzle with 1 tsp of oil. Wrap tightly with foil and place on the baking tray with the vegetables. Bake for 30-40 minutes, tossing every 15 minutes or so and checking the garlic at 25 minutes to make sure it doesn't burn or dry out.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>For the Stew Base</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, sauté the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 3 or 4 minutes until the onion is softened. Add the oregano, basil, thyme, canned tomatoes, vegetable broth and red lentils. Turn the heat up to high until the stew comes to a boil, lower the heat, cover and let simmer for about 10 minutes or until the lentils are cooked, stirring occasionally to prevent lentils from sticking to the pot.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skins into a high-powered blender. Add tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, about 1/2 of the roasted vegetables, and ladle in about 2 cups of the soup. Blend on high until smooth. Pour this mixture back into the soup pot with the other half of the roasted vegetables. Over medium heat, stir the kale into the soup and cook about a minute until it's just wilted and bright green. Enjoy!</li>
